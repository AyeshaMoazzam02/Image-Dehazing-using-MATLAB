we implemented a haze removal algorithm based on the haze imaging model and dark channel prior. The process was carried out in four steps including atmospheric light estimation, transmission map estimation, transmission map refinement and finally scene recovery. To suppress the halo artifacts and blocking artifacts in the dehazed image, the guided filter was used. The dataset set was obtained from different internet sources. Experimental results show that the technique is effective and it successfully removes haze from the images and an enhanced and better quality image is obtained as output. Results also show that the use of guided filter instead of the soft matting technique reduces the run time of the algorithm and the images can be processed efficiently. This makes the real time application of the algorithm possible. The depth map of the image can also be obtained using this technique which is a ill posed problem otherwise. This technique can be utilized in a number of computer vision applications including outdoor surveillance systems, intelligent transporation systems, outdoor cameras and photography.
